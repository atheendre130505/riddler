Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data. There are three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning learns through trial and error with rewards and penalties.
